    * uses xor: hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 33 ^ str[i]; the magic of number 33

    * Description: This algorithm was created for sdbm (a public-domain
    * reimplementation of ndbm) database library. It was found to do
    * well in scrambling bits, causing better distribution of the
    * keys and fewer splits. It also happens to be a good general hashing
    * function with good distribution. The actual function is
    *hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 65599 + str[i]; what is included below
    * is the faster version used in gawk. [* there is even a faster,
    * duff-device version] the magic constant 65599 was picked out of
    * thin air while experimenting with different constants, and turns
    * out to be a prime. this is one of the algorithms used in
    * berkeley db (see sleepycat) and elsewhere.
